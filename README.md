# Getting started

This is my little shell script that I wrote to dump the annotations from iBooks.  (I think) The only think that needs to be changed in the Book title variable in the shell script.  

This little script just dumps the ibooks of a target book (using the title) into a semi-colon delimated file in /tmp.  You can then import this into Anki since Anki will import csv files.
